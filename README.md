### Notes
* No shortcut to succeed. You have to experiment and practice
* There's no one way to do things
* Expectation: you're not going to be an expert (you can't build FaceBook, but you can break it down into components)
* FUN! You're gonna create things 

### Housekeeping
* In the real world, being able to work with someone with different set and level of skill is invaluable.
* Take advantage of that dynamic! You both can learn from each other. 

### Slides 
* First two weeks is focused on the **front-end** the client that is being used by the user
